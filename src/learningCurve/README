This directory contains the scripts to obtain a learning curve for LR classifiers on CASF-PPI-2017 dataset. Twenty LR classifiers (A through T) are independently trained on a fraction of the full dataset. Twenty replicates were chosen for full coverage of the training set on the smallest fraction.

Once trained, the training and validation accuracies are returned by the cv_results_ attribute of the pickled sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV class. Test accuracies are obtained by recording the accuracy of the classification on the partitioned test set.
